# Personal Website
This is a website hosted by Github Pages and generated by Jekyll. The site is a modified version of Pixyll, a theme that excels in simplicity, speed and modification.

# Prerequisites
To make a website hosted on Github Pages, first you have to have a github account, you can make one at:
https://github.com

After you have a github account, look into the official guide of Github Pages to get started
https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics

Depend on your site purpose, you can grab a free template at [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) to modify at your own taste.
The one I'm using is [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com/), a very light weight and customizable template. I love the speed and simplicity of it.
