Hi, I’m Aamir !

I’m a Computer Science student at [Lassonde School of Engineering](http://lassonde.yorku.ca/) – [York University](http://www.yorku.ca/index.html).

I’ve worked with several different languages and platforms so far including: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Ghost, Magento and Opencart. I am still going through the learning process at school and home. Now a days I am learning Node.JS and Java.

I work as a freeelance web developer. When I’m not trying to develop great things or studying, I’m attempting to take great photos, playing video games and listening to EDM. (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ

Feel free to contact me. If you’re inclined, you can drop me an [email](mailto:aamirsa@my.yorku.ca), follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/entirix), circle me on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+AamirAhmads), and code with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/aamirsahmad).
