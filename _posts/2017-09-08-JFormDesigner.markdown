I try to design a simple calculator using a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA called [JFormDesigner](https://www.formdev.com/)
The plugin generates codes for the GUI of the program and from there I can modify and adding more algorithms to the calculator. I was having a fun time playing with it although there are plenty of funny outcome from my silly algorithms. :)

#Update: I have included the [github](https://percytran96.github.io/projects/) link in Projects tab.
