I try to design a simple calculator using a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA called [JFormDesigner](https://www.formdev.com/)
The plugin generates codes for the GUI of the program and from there I can modify and adding more algorithms to the calculator. I was having a fun time playing with it although there are plenty of funny outcome from my silly algorithms. :)

*Update: The calculator worked and I have included the github link in [Projects](https://percytran96.github.io/projects/) tab, may be in the future I'll put it in [webswing](http://webswing.org/#!/home).
